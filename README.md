Short Description 

South Africa faces a massive shortage of nurses and doctors with a ratio of 1 doctor to 3198 patients and I have witnessed this first-hand at Osindisweni Hospital, Addington Hospital, and other hospitals; every month when I take my grandmum to the hospital. It has become increasingly bad as patients are neglected, becoming sicker, and sometimes even dying (I witnessed this first-hand when my grandmum was admitted to Osinidisweni hospital and one of the patients in her ward died due to lack of care). I have invented, researched, designed, tested, and implemented a solution to this issue. This solution is a Patient Health monitoring system and medication dispenser which doctors can control remotely through a web server. The solution monitors the patientâ€™s heart rate, oxygen levels, and blood pressure, then uploads this to the web server. The doctor can then dispense medication to the patient through the same web server and check if they are taking their medication. Patients who are waiting in the medication dispensary can also get tablets quicker through the medication dispenser, rather than waiting from 5 am to 12 pm (elderly people cannot handle this long wait). This helps patients and medical staff.
